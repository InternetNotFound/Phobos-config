# Phobos-config
This is a good config for crystal aura Phobos 1.7 to 1.9.0 
download the config from here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/807236118722117684/815420961616691220/AutoCrystal.json
To add the config 
press win key + r
then type C:\Users\Lenovo\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\phobos\config\Combat
then replace the config with the last one
and now have a good pvp and good day.
